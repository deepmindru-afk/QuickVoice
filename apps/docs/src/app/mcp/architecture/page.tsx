      <h1>MCP architecture</h1>
      <p>
        QuickVoice uses a dedicated Node MCP service and a separate Next.js docs site. The docs site may contain the MCP landing page,
        setup guide, client configuration generator, API reference, and troubleshooting content. The actual MCP endpoint should remain in
        <code>apps/mcp-server</code>.
      </p>

      <h2>Recommended app boundary</h2>
      <CodeBlock code={`apps/docs       → Human-facing documentation, MCP setup UI, API reference
apps/mcp-server → Machine-facing Streamable HTTP MCP endpoint
apps/server     → Existing QuickVoice REST API source of truth
apps/ai         → Voice AI worker/runtime
apps/console    → Main QuickVoice product console`} />

      <h2>Why not put MCP backend inside Next.js?</h2>
      <div className="not-prose grid gap-4">
        {choices.map((choice) => (
          <section key={choice.title} className="rounded-2xl border border-[var(--qv-border)] bg-white p-5 shadow-sm">
            <h3 className="text-base font-semibold tracking-tight text-slate-950">{choice.title}</h3>
            <p className="mt-2 text-sm leading-6 text-[var(--qv-muted)]">{choice.body}</p>
          </section>
        ))}
      </div>

      <h2>Production domain layout</h2>
      <CodeBlock code={`docs.quickvoice.co        → apps/docs
mcp.quickvoice.co/mcp    → apps/mcp-server
api.quickvoice.co/api/v1 → apps/server`} />

      <h2>When a combined Next.js app is acceptable</h2>
      <p>
        A combined Next.js deployment is acceptable only for a very small internal deployment where one service is easier to operate than
        clean separation. If that route is chosen, keep <code>/mcp</code> implemented as backend-only route handlers, keep public docs pages
        separate from MCP auth, and preserve the same validation and smoke tests used by <code>apps/mcp-server</code>.
      </p>

      <h2>Decision</h2>
      <p>
        For QuickVoice production, use <code>apps/mcp-server</code> for MCP and <code>apps/docs</code> for documentation. This keeps the MCP
        runtime smaller, easier to scale, easier to secure, and easier to debug independently from public docs traffic.
