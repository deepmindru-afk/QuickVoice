# First Call Resolution for Voice AI: Define and Verify the Outcome

First call resolution should describe whether a customer's issue was resolved during the initial contact under an explicit measurement rule. It should not be inferred from a short call, the absence of a transfer, or the model's own success label.

This guide proposes a measurement design for an AI phone pilot. It does not claim that AI consistently outperforms people or supply a universal industry target. Define your own task and evidence before using FCR as a launch or expansion criterion.

## Decide what resolution means

For an information request, review whether the answer was correct, complete for the approved scope, and useful to the caller. For an action, inspect the authoritative system. A delivered callback request may complete an intake task while leaving the underlying customer issue unresolved; report those outcomes separately.

| Outcome | Suggested reporting treatment |
|---|---|
| Approved answer verified during review | Candidate resolved information request |
| Authorized action confirmed in destination | Candidate resolved transaction |
| Person completes the issue during the same call | Assisted resolution, kept distinct from AI-only completion |
| Callback or review task delivered | Successful routing/intake; underlying resolution still pending |
| Caller disconnects or stops responding | Unknown unless other evidence establishes the result |
| Tool fails or record is missing | Unresolved action, even if the agent said “done” |

Specify whether same-call transfers count in your overall FCR definition. Keep that rule consistent across periods and show the assisted subset. Do not hide helpful human involvement merely to improve an automation metric.

## Match repeat contacts carefully

Choose an observation window appropriate for the task and state it in the report. A caller may use another channel or number, while several people may share a phone. Match by the approved issue/account process where possible and keep uncertain links visible.

A repeat call about a different question should not automatically invalidate the first result. Conversely, no observed repeat call is not proof of satisfaction: the person may have given up or used an untracked route. Use receiving-system evidence, sampled review, and optional feedback to strengthen the assessment.

## Use a denominator that includes failures

Calculate the share of eligible initial contacts meeting the stated resolution rule. Show the total eligible population, unresolved cases, unknowns, and exclusions. If an unknown subset is excluded from a secondary calculation, label that calculation and report its coverage.

Segment by task, language, route, and relevant configuration rather than comparing an AI queue of simple requests with a staff queue of complex disputes. Track changes to call mix, staffing, and instructions alongside the metric.

## Improve the specific failure mechanism

Review failed cases for stale knowledge, ambiguous identification, insufficient permissions, unavailable systems, unclear alternatives, or incorrect confirmation. Fix the relevant cause and re-test that path. Adding more FAQ text will not repair a failed write or a broken phone transfer.

QuickVoice's [repository](https://github.com/allgpt-co/QuickVoice) supports implementation inspection, but its logs do not automatically establish your FCR definition. Its [MCP handler](https://github.com/allgpt-co/QuickVoice/blob/main/apps/ai/handlers/mcp_handler.py) restricts marked write/side-effect tools, so the allowed action path matters to what resolution is possible.

Use the [customer-support cost guide](/blog/ai-voice-agents-reduce-customer-support-costs) to consider operating effort alongside quality. A credible report explains both what improved and what remains unresolved, with enough evidence for another reviewer to reproduce the classification.
